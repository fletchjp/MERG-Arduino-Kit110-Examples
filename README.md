# MERG-Arduino-Kit110-Examples
 This is for example software for the MERG Kit 110 Arduino Shield
 
 ## CANshield_LCDBut
 
 This is an example of the use of a CANshield with a DFRobot shield with a 2 by 16 LCD display and a set of buttons.
 
 This example shows how it is possible to send and receive events which are integrated with the buttons and the display.
 
 It is also possible to receive a query and reply giving the state of the display.
 
 Further information will be found in a README file included with the example.

## CANshield_LCDBut_1280

This is a version of the same code adapted to run on a MEGA 1280 which has a larger memory than a UNO with therefore more scope for development.
